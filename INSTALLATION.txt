=== INSTALLATION.txt ===

Requirements:

ccg requires a recent version of perl (tested with perl v5.16.3) 
with the Cwd core module.  


Installation:
The following directions assume a basic working understanding 
of shell computing (e.g. Terminal.app on MacOS). The example 
commands listed here have been tested to work in a default
installation of MacOSX v10.10. They may need to be modified 
depending on your computer setup. 

1) Download ccg from BitBucket at:
     https://bitbucket.org/gallaher/custom-chlamy-generator/downloads

2) Move the zip file to a convenient location and expand it with 
   your unzip app of choice. For example, type:
		unzip gallaher-custom-chlamy-generator-*.zip

3) Change into the ccg directory. For example, type:
		cd gallaher-custom-chlamy-generator-*

4) Make ccg executable. For example:
		chmod 755 ccg

5) Run the ccg manual for further instructions. Type:
      		./ccg -h   

4) Optional: Create a symlink to ccg in your $PATH to run the app
   in other working directories. The data directory and the ccg app
   must stay in the same directory.
