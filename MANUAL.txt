=== CCG v1.4 Manual ===

ccg can be run in one of two modes:

Mode 1, you can ask ccg for the list of strains that it has 
variant calls for, and then run ccg for one of those strains.
                   - or -
Mode 2, for a strain that is not included, you can specify a pattern 
of haplotype 2 blocks and a strain name of your choosing. 

In either mode, ccg generates three files:
1) a strain-specific reference genome in multi-fasta format
2) coordinate-adjusted gene annotations in gff3 format
3) a report summarizing the results

Those variants that are predicted by SnpEff to have nonsense and frameshift
mutations relative the standard reference are highlighted in the report,
and have an added notation in the gff3 file. 


Options:

ccg -s <strain-name>	Run ccg in mode 1. If <strain-name> is one of the known strains, 
			ccg will generate a multifasta and gff file for that
			strain.

ccg -l 			Print a list of strains that are known to ccg. Choose
			a strain from the list, and re-run ccg with the -s option and
			the strain name.	
			Note that the strain name must be coppied exactly. 

ccg -c <your-hap-file>	Run ccg in mode 2 to generate a multifasta and gff file for 
			any standard laboratory strain with a user-specified haplotype 
			pattern. Before running in mode 2, you must edit the 
			copy_and_edit_this_file_for_custom_haplotype.txt 
			file to specify the desired haplotype 2 regions. 
			Name your edited file with the name of your strain, 
			and enter that same name after the -c (see below for details).

ccg -h 			Print the help manual. 


To specify a haplotype pattern for a strain that is unknown to ccg (i.e. run in mode 2), 
do the following:

1) Make a copy of copy_and_edit_this_file_for_custom_haplotype.txt 
   in your working directory. Make the name of your copy the name of your strain.
       e.g. if your strain is CC-4351, make a copy of edit_this_file.txt called CC-4351
       Your strain-specific reference genome and annotation files 
       will be called CC-4351.fa and CC-4351.gff.

 2) Open your copy in a text editor, and change the 1 in the first column 
    to a 2 for any block that is haplotype 2 in your strain.

 3) Run ccg -c <name-of-yourâ€”new-file>
         ( e.g. ccg -c CC-4351 )
