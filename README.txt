Custom Chlamy Generator

ccg is a program to generate a strain-specific reference genome 
and annotation file for any of the standard laboratory strains 
of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. 

This facilitates more accurate RNA-seq studies in Chlamydomonas.

For more details, see:

Strains Reveals a Mosaic of Sequence Variation, Identifies
True Strain Histories, and Enables Strain-Specific Studies.

ccg can be run on the command line of most *nix computers  
(MacOS, Linux, etc.) equipped with PERL.  

It outputs the results in standard formats 
(fasta and GFF3) that can be used by 
common RNA-seq analysis pipelines.

For detailed instructions on how to use ccg, type:
./ccg -h 
in your favorite terminal.
