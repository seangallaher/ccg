   CC-4533
   1A+


v1.4
27-JUN-2016
This version adds:
1) CCG now correctly adjusts the "phase" in the 
   gff annotation file for genes with frame-shift
   InDels. Thanks to Olivier Vallon (IBPC) 
   for bringing this bug to my attention.
2) Various bug fixes and minor improvements.

v1.3.1 
21-APR-2016
Minor bug fix:
Corrects problem where SnpEff high impact variants
with warnings cause a fault.

v1.3
29-JUL-2015
This version adds:
1) Genes that are predicted by SnpEff to have high impact variants 
   (frame shifts and nonsense variants) are now labeled in the
   strain-specific annotation file. Additionally, the number of 
   high impact variants is listed in the report file.
2) Various bug fixes and minor improvements. 

v1.2
15-MAY-2015
This version adds:
1) Mode 1 will now use all strain-specific variants, not just haplotype-specific ones.
2) Awareness of multiple variants at the same locus.

v1.1
06-MAY-2015
This version adds:
1) The ability to make a custom genome and annotation
   file for any strain with a known pattern of haplotype 2 blocks. 
2) Greatly expanded documentation. 
3) Additional validation of user inputs with feedback. 
4) Progress of each stage is sent to STDOUT. 

v1.0
